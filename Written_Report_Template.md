## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The most successful theater projects were launched in May. However, the most failed projects were also in May. The lowest number of successful projects were launched in December. Both failed and successful projects have a similar trend but the successful project launch high was in May with 111 successful projects launched. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

76% of projects with a goal of less than $1,000 were successful. This is the highest success rate. 0% of projects with a goal of $45,000-$49,999 were not successful. The visualization of these outcomes are inverse. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I did not run into any major challeneges. The difficulty I had, was having to resue formulas multiple times over and changing key parts, rather than typing them out from scratch each time. By duplicating them and changing the needed information, it took less time, but i struggled with making sure not to click outside of the cell, causing the formula to change.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  - The best month to launch a successful theater project is in May.
  - The worst failed month is also May.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  - Projects that have a lower goal, have a better outcome.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  - I do not feel that there are any major limitations to the dataset and that there is ample data to draw conclusions from.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  - I would suggest added tables about number of backers in relation to the goal being met.
